# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for TapeAge. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Vintage tape saturator with warm saturation and musical degradation
- Parameters specified: DRIVE (0-100%), AGE (0-100%), MIX (0-100%)
- UI vision captured: Medium rectangle, vintage VU meter, 3 brass knobs, creamy beige background, 60s/70s aesthetic
- Use cases identified: Warmth, lo-fi processing, vintage character, parallel processing

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start implementation directly
3. Research tape saturation algorithms and wow/flutter DSP

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Audio Effect (Tape Saturator)
- Core concept: Warm tape saturation with controllable degradation (wow/flutter/dropout/noise)
- AGE parameter must remain musical even at maximum—never "stupid" sounding
- Visual aesthetic: 60s/70s tape machine, earth tones, brass knobs, vintage VU meter

**Files Created:**
- plugins/TapeAge/.ideas/creative-brief.md
- PLUGINS.md (registry entry added)
