# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 0 Complete - Ready for Planning

Research phase complete. DSP architecture documented with JUCE module specifications. Ready to proceed to Stage 1 (Planning).

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type: Audio Effect (Reverb)
- Professional examples researched (Valhalla Room, FabFilter Pro-R, UAD Galaxy Tape Echo)
- JUCE modules identified: `dsp::Reverb`, `dsp::IIR::Filter`, `dsp::WaveShaper`, `dsp::DryWetMixer`
- DSP architecture specification created (`architecture.md`)
- Parameter ranges validated against industry standards

## Next Steps

1. Stage 1: Planning (calculate complexity score, create implementation plan)
2. Review research findings
3. Pause here

## Context to Preserve

**Plugin Type:** Audio Effect (Reverb)

**Processing:** Algorithmic reverb with tape saturation (wet only) and DJ-style filter

**JUCE Modules:**
- `juce::dsp::Reverb` - Algorithmic reverb engine
- `juce::dsp::IIR::Filter<float>` - DJ-style filter (low-pass/high-pass with center bypass)
- `juce::dsp::WaveShaper<float>` - Drive saturation (tanh transfer function)
- `juce::dsp::DryWetMixer<float>` - Equal-power dry/wet blending

**Signal Flow:**
- PRE mode: Input → Reverb → Filter → Drive → Dry/Wet Mix → Output
- POST mode: Input → Reverb → Drive → Filter → Dry/Wet Mix → Output

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Reverb: `juce::dsp::Reverb` sufficient for v1 (consider custom FDN in v2)
- Filter: `dsp::IIR::Filter` with Butterworth coefficients (Q=0.707)
- Drive: `tanh()` waveshaping for even harmonics (tape-like saturation)
- Routing: Conditional branching for PRE/POST switching (efficient)

**Files Created:**
- `plugins/DriveVerb/.ideas/architecture.md` (DSP specification contract)
